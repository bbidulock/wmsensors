This install will probably mean two stages, unless you already have
lm_sensors-2.[x>=1] installed. If you have, go to the second part.
Otherwise, read on...

First, make and install lm_sensors-2.[x>=1]. This program does not support
the various other sensor modules around; if you want to use them then
you need wmlm78, which provides much of the same functionality as this
program, but is not actively maintained much (though I will include real 
showstopper bugfixes). You must install lmsensors-2 properly so that the 
sensors library can be found and linked against.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

You now need to make and install the wmsensors program to show the data
from your sensors in a spiffy and sometimes useful way.
Do this as follows:

1. Check the Imakefile to see if all the LIBS are ok for your system.
   Also, check DESTDIR and BINDIR; as they are now, a `make install'
   will put the wmsensors binary in /usr/X11R6/bin.
2. $ `xmkmf'
3. $ `make'
4. # `make install'
5. # cp wmsensors.1x /usr/X11R6/man/man1
6. Enjoy!!!!

If you have any problems at all with this program, please e-mail me at
adrian.baugh@keble.ox.ac.uk, and I will be glad to help. Especially if
you have a system on which this doesn't work, I want to hear from you!
I may not be able to fix it immediately, but I'll certainly try.

Also, if you know how Imakefiles work and can tell me how to write an
Imakefile  that  produces a Makefile that puts the man  page  in  the
right place during make install I will be very grateful.
