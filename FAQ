                  wmsensors Frequently Asked Questions
             ==============================================

                                  or,

             Qs I think might have been FA without this FAQ

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: Why can't I drag the wmsensors window into the dock? It just opens the
   man page or gives a text output of my sensor chips.
A: You probably forgot to run the program with the -s -w switches. These
   are needed for Window Maker dock programs; they aren't enabled by
   default to increase the chance of this working with other WMs if people
   want.
   Also, you need to drag the icon window across by its border. Useful
   commands are triggered by clicking in the actual wmsensors window.

Q: Why doesn't the wmsensors tarball include lm_sensors any more?
A: Because lm_sensors is big and is updated independently of wmsensors. It
   doesn't need me promoting it any more; it's on its way into the official
   kernel soon. You can get it yourself from http://www.lm-sensors.nu

Q: Is wmsensors Y2K compliant.
A: There isn't a single date reference in the code. 

Q: I tried wmsensors -a and it didn't work. Why is my nice PC now a heap
   of molten slag?
A: There isn't a default alarm command; you must specify one as follows:
   wmsensors -a my_script would execute my_script (must be in your path!)
   in the event of one of the alarms being triggered.
   As for the heap of slag, you haven't been overclocking have you? ;-)'

If you have any other questions, e-mail me at adrian.baugh@keb.ox.ac.uk
I'll answer them if I can, and list them in the FAQ if they are likely to
become FAQs.
