Changes log for wmsensors: last updated 19991203

Changes since wmsensors-1.0.3:
      o Added support for more sensors. Fixed some minor bugs and one
	really stupid one. Made the program work even if some sensors
	don't return a proper reading.
Changes since wmsensors-1.0.2:
      o Added a wmsensors.spec file, thanks to Ian Macdonald. Now I just
	need time to make some nice updated RPMs!
Changes since wmsensors-1.0.0:
      o Lars Kellogg-Stedman pointed out a way to dispense with the
	sensors.less.sh kluge, so the program is now more self-contained
	and doesn't need an extra shell script lying around the system.
	Thanks Lars!

Changes since wmsensors-0.99.0:
      o All the chips supported in lm_sensors 2.2.0 are supported in
	wmsensors v1.0.0.
      o The graphs are now plotted using a scaling based on the sensor
	limits rather than the arbitrary scaling I used up till now. This
	is important since I don't know how all sensor chips are wired up;
	now I don't need to care, either.
      o Support for user-defined commands to be executed when the alarms
	are triggered has been added.
      o Some typos have been fixed. These were all cosmetic though.

Changes since wmlm78:
      o I've sorted out the sloppy copyright notices which appeared to
	license wmlm78 under either the GPL or a BSD-style license. Future
	versions of wmlm78, as well as all versions of wmsensors, are
	released under the GPL only.
      o Support for lm_sensors v1 and the Beowulf lm78 module has been
	removed; wmsensors requires libsensors to compile, and if you have
	this then you have lm_sensors v2 anyway. If you must use one of
	the older modules, stick with wmlm78 for now. By the time wmsensors
	becomes stable, lm_sensors-2.x will also be stable and will have
	entirely supplanted lm_sensors-1.x.
      o Support for lm_sensors v2 has been added. Currently it will work with
	lm75, lm78, lm79, lm80, w83781d (Winbond) chips and there is some code
	which may or may not work with gl815 chips. Any feedback (at all!) on
	these chips is especially welcomed.
      o A logging option has been added. wmsensors -r filename will dump all
	the data wmsensors collects to a file called filename. (Note that
	wmsensors -r - may be used to write data to stdout.)

 Adrian Baugh.
